**Fast & performant React Native list. No more blank cells.**

Swap from FlatList in seconds. Get instant performance.

## Installation

<Tabs
  defaultValue="react-native"
  values={[
    { label: "React Native", value: "react-native" },
    { label: "Expo", value: "expo" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="react-native">
Add the package to your project via:

```bash
yarn add @shopify/flash-list
```

and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory. If you don't use React Native CLI's
[autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md)
feature, you will need to manually link the dependency - read
[here](/guides/manual-linking) to learn more.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expo">

```bash
expo install @shopify/flash-list expo-dev-client
```

You can then run the app on iOS or Android via:

```bash
expo run:ios
# or
expo run:android
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
