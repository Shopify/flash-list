FlashList can then use this information to decide how many items it needs to draw on the screen before initial load and while scrolling. If most of the items are of different sizes, you can think of an average or median value and if most items are of the same size, just use that number. A quick look at Element Inspector can help you determine this. If you\'re confused between two values, the smaller value is a better choice.","sidebar":"autoSidebar"},"fundamentals/metrics":{"id":"fundamentals/metrics","title":"Metrics","description":"FlashList enables you to track metrics in production that can give you more insight into how your app is doing in terms of performance.

When an item gets out of the viewport, instead of being destroyed, the component is re-rendered with a different item prop. For example, if you make use of useState in a reused component, you may see state values that were set for that component when it was associated with a different item in the list, and would then need to reset any previously set state when a new item is rendered:","sidebar":"autoSidebar"},"fundamentals/usage":{"id":"fundamentals/usage","title":"Usage","description":"If you are familiar with FlatList, you already know how to use FlashList.
